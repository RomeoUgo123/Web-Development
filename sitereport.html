        I love to take a challenge and I am very meticulous in my approach to fight any task hat comes my way. This is I took on this course, first of all, I want to start off with HTML as a whole. HTML has been a roller coaster for me, I have had many ups and many downs where I would struggle with coding all day but overall, the experience has been fun.</p>
        <p>I have learnt to use tags efficiently and have learnt to create many pages in HTML and CSS. Next id like to share my experience with CSS. CSS was really difficult for me as to being a new HTML coder, I did not realise that I needed to have CSS to help design my Website. I am very pleased to how much I have developed and how much information I have gathered to further my understanding in this subject. 
One of my biggest struggle was getting my contacts page to work and getting the right colour scheme. My contacts page at first would not allow me to click the ‘submit’ button however when I overcame this, I was very much pleased. My biggest achievement from this assignment has been actually creating a functional website that allows me to travel from link to link between each page.
